    <center> <h2> ABOUT THE MOVIE </h2> </center>
    <p>The name of my last movie is Chhota Bheem Kung fu Dhamaka.
       The main character of the movie was Bheem. He was a young boy,
       very strong , considerate and smart . He loved to fight . 
       One day, he heard that there was a fighting contest in China , he came there 
       with his friends too . When all the matches were played it was time for
        Kusa ,the world champion to fight , no one agreed to fight him. Then 
        Bheem came in to the tournament to fight Kusa leaving everyone 
        surprised .<p> In fact, the commentator thought Bheem was going to lose
        because of his size , but he eventually won . After Bheem had beaten Kusa,
        it was time for round two. Just as round two was going on ,a 
        mysterious creature came crashing down on the obstacle which was used 
        for round two and that mysterious creature was Zuhu ,the nephew of 
        the King of China and his goal was to capture the princess of China
        who was also known as the Angel of China and the light of China so he 
        could use her to call the mayan dragon which was also known as their 
        God and Zuhu knew that his cousin, Kia shared a special connection with
        the dragon so used her to get the divine fireball which was the power
        of the mayan dragon and he wanted the fire ball so that he could 
        become extremely powerful and he could power his army that would destroy 
        China .</p> Bheem also sneaked in to Zuhu's castle with his friends in a
        circus cart dressed like circus actors and when they entered Zuhu's castle,
        they saw their friend Kia but she did not know that they were her 
        friends because of their costumes . There were three men ordered by Zuhu 
        to hypnotise the princess so she would call the dragon, but they 
        failed. Then they asked the circus group to help to and that was what 
        they did .<p> During thier act, Kia thought that they were evil people 
        but when Bheem was doing the trapeze while juggling Laddu the princess 
        quickly stood up to watch their act and when Ming diguised stretched 
        his hand for the princess to join them, she did. So after they had gotten
        Kia they were ready for their escape. So that was what they did.
        But when they got to the bridge, they were stopped by Zuhu and then Bheem
        challenged Zuhu to a fight .</p> At first , Bheem looked like he was going to
        win but Zuhu later injured him severely. Luckily, an old man saved Bheem
        and his friends from drowning and also taught Bheem a new fighting
        style. He was able to defeat Zuhu and restore peace to China and 
        for his good deeds and warrior skills to save the princess and defeat
        Zuhu, he was awarded the dragon trophy
