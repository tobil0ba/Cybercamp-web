        <h2> ABOUT THE FOOD </h2>
    </u>
    <p>The name of my favourite food is Spaghetti. It is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.It is a
        staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat
        and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from
        durum wheat semolina.Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used but whole wheat
        flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin
        spaghetti.</p>
    <p> Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the
        latter half of the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in 25â€“30 cm { 10-12 in }
        lengths. A variety of pasta dishes are based on it and it is frequently served with tomato
        sauce or meat or vegetables.The first written record of pasta comes from the Talmud in the 5th
        century AD and refers to dried pasta that could be cooked through boiling, which was
        conveniently portable.</p>
    <p> Some historians think that Berbers introduced pasta to Europe during a conquest of Sicily. In
        the West, it may have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century,
        as the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi attested, reporting some traditions about the
        Sicilian kingdom.The popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment of
        spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of spaghetti for the
        Italian market.
